# Windows desktop setup for DevOps

This is just a bunch of helper files that make it easy for me to setup my Windows workstation.  Why not linux?  Because Macs suck and many companies only have Windows as a second option.

## Git helper

These are just a bunch of handy alias's I drop in my .gitconfig.

## Packages Config

A chocolatey package with all the apps I use.  Easier than installing everything from memory.

## Powershell Profile

Things that are convenient and the way I like them.

## VSCode Extension Pack

Experimental, just trying it out.  Hopefully it saves me in the future.  If not, at least I have a list of extensions.
